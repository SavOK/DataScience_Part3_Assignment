##Description of original data and experiment
---
Experiment was done on a group of 30 volunteers. Participants performed different tasks while wearing a smartphone _Samsung Galaxy S II_ on their waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. Authors measured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.
The sensor signals were  pre-processed by applying noise filters and the sampled in fixed width window of 2.56 sec and 50 overlap (128 readings/window). The signal from accelerometer was divided in two components (gravitational and body motion) by Butterworts low-path filter. 
From each each window, a vector of features was calculated from the time and frequency domain. For more details please read [dataset page]
